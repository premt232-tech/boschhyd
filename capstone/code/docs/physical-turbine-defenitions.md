Of course. Let's clarify the practical implementation and the specifics of the turbine data.

### Number of Turbines and Data Source

This dataset represents the performance of a **single Gas Turbine (GT)** propulsion plant.

The `README.txt` file and the technical documentation explain that the data does not come from a physical ship but from a **highly realistic numerical simulator**. This simulator models a naval frigate's propulsion system, which consists of one gas turbine driving two propellers (Port and Starboard) through a gearbox.

So, while the ship has two propellers, the data you are analyzing pertains to the single gas turbine that powers them. This is why features like "Starboard Propeller Torque" and "Port Propeller Torque" exist, but they are both driven by the same core engine.

### Understanding the Terminology

The terms `T1`, `T2`, and `T48` are standard station designations in gas turbine engineering that denote specific points in the engine's thermodynamic cycle. Here is what they mean, based on the `Features.txt` file:

* **T1: GT Compressor Inlet Air Temperature (°C)**
    * This is the temperature of the ambient air as it is about to enter the gas turbine's compressor. It's a critical measurement of the initial state of the air.

* **T2: GT Compressor Outlet Air Temperature (°C)**
    * This is the temperature of the air *after* it has been compressed by the compressor section but *before* it enters the combustion chamber. The ratio of `T2` to `P2` (compressor outlet pressure) is a primary indicator of the compressor's efficiency.

* **T48: HP Turbine Exit Temperature (°C)**
    * This is the temperature of the hot gas *after* it has passed through the High-Pressure (HP) Turbine section but before it goes on to do more work (e.g., in a Low-Pressure Turbine) or exits as exhaust. This measurement is crucial for monitoring the health and performance of the turbine itself.


In summary, you are analyzing detailed simulated data from **one gas turbine** powering a two-propeller naval vessel. The `T` values represent temperatures at key stages of the turbine's operation: air intake (`T1`), post-compression (`T2`), and post-turbine (`T48`).
